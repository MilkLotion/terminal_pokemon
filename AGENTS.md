# Repository Guidelines

## Source of Truth and History

Keep project knowledge in `docs/`.

- `docs/progress.md`: current stage, next action, and validation status.
- `docs/design.md`: architecture and accepted decisions.
- `docs/specs/<feature>.md`: current feature contracts.
- `docs/work/<task>/record.md`: design, work, review, feedback, and revision in one record.
- `docs/work/<task>/evidence/`: observations, JSON, and screenshots for that task.
- `docs/history/YYYY-MM.md`: concise dated record of completed work cycles.
- `docs/terms.md`: canonical name and meaning for each user-facing term.

Keep only README, design, progress, terms, and guide at the docs root. Reuse an existing task record for follow-up work. Do not create separate plan/review/feedback files for each small edit. Keep existing split records in their task folder. Follow [the workflow](docs/contributing/workflow.md).

Link source files, data, commands, and review evidence. Resolve conflicts with `design.md` for decisions and `progress.md` for status. Code proves current behavior, not user approval. Preserve reasons, corrections, constraints, and context beside the relevant task. Link them from the affected specification. Record the source and whether a claim is confirmed or proposed. Never infer missing intent.

## Required Work Cycle

Use this order for every feature or bug fix:

Role instructions: [design](docs/contributing/roles/design.md), [work](docs/contributing/roles/work.md), [review](docs/contributing/roles/review.md), [feedback](docs/contributing/roles/feedback.md), and [revision](docs/contributing/roles/revision.md).

1. **Design:** record goal, scope, SSOT files, risks, and acceptance checks.
2. **Work:** make a focused change. Update the existing task record and affected specification.
3. **Review:** run relevant checks. Record commands and results.
4. **Feedback:** list failures, ambiguity, and review comments.
5. **Revision:** fix findings, rerun affected checks, and update changed facts only. Add one concise entry to the current monthly history when the work cycle ends.

Do not commit or push with open findings. For design-only work, stop after Design and mark implementation as not started.

## ASD-STE100 Writing

Read [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) for the document map and evidence priority. Apply [`docs/contributing/writing.md`](docs/contributing/writing.md) to every changed technical passage. Use one fact or instruction per sentence, exact identifiers, one term per concept, and conditions before actions. Separate user decisions, observations, proposals, and historical results. Korean text applies these principles; it does not claim formal ASD-STE100 compliance.

Before completion, manually review changed prose with the writing checklist. Record the scope and result in the task record. Run `node scripts/check-docs.cjs` and `git diff --check` for document changes. The script checks structure and references, not semantic correctness or STE compliance. Do not run builds or lint automatically for document-only work.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: TypeScript runtime. Main process is in `src/main/`; other features are grouped by module.
- `src/renderer/`: stage and picker windows.
- `data/`: editable rules and species data. `lib/`: generated or compatibility JavaScript.
- `art/`, `assets/`: sprite and logo assets. `scripts/`, `bin/`, `helpers/`: packaging tools.
- `vscode-extension/`: VS Code companion. `docs/`: records.

## Build and Test Commands

Use Node.js `>=22.12` and npm.

```powershell
npm install                 # install dependencies and run postinstall
npm run build               # compile main and renderer to dist/
npm run check               # type-check without output
npm run selftest            # build and run all self-tests
npm start                   # build and launch Electron
npm run data:build          # rebuild generated data
npm run build:vsix          # package the VS Code extension
```

Run a focused check, such as `node dist/tools/selftest-shop.js`, after building.

## Style and Naming

Use TypeScript. Follow nearby files for two-space indentation, semicolons, and single quotes. Use `camelCase` for values and functions, `PascalCase` for types and classes, and kebab-case for CLI commands and data files. Rebuild after source changes; never edit `dist/` by hand. Keep strings in i18n files.

## Commits, PRs, and Safety

Use short imperative subjects, such as `feat: S4 해금·상점·진화` or `docs: add S5 settings design preview`. Keep commits focused. PRs describe behavior, checks, plan or issue links, and UI screenshots when relevant. Use temporary data or HOME paths. Treat saves, hooks, and mailbox data as user-owned. Preserve Electron IPC checks, context isolation, and sandbox settings.
